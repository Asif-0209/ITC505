        <p> <strong> V.Lord Derby's house.</strong></p>
        <p>Enter DERBY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK</p>
        <p><strong>DERBY</strong></p>
        <p>Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:<br>
        That in the sty of this most bloody boar<br>
        My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:<br>
        If I revolt, off goes young George's head;<br>
        The fear of that withholds my present aid.<br>
        But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?</p>
        <p><strong>CHRISTOPHER</strong></p>
        <p>At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.</p>
        <p><strong>DERBY</strong></p>
        <p>What men of name resort to him?</p>
        <p><strong>CHRISTOPHER</strong></p>
        <p>Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;<br>
        Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;<br>
        Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,<br>
        And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;<br>
        And many more of noble fame and worth:<br>
        And towards London they do bend their course,<br>
        If by the way they be not fought withal.</p>
        <p><strong>DERBY</strong></p>
        <p>Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:<br>
        Tell him the queen hath heartily consented<br>
        He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.<br>
        These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.</p>
        <p>Exeunt</p>
